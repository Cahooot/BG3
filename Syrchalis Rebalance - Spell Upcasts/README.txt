Specific things to note for each folder

General:
- I'm assuming you'll add the upcast versions one by one to your own .txt files so I'm just including only the .txt files with changes
- Absolutely 0% chance there aren't any mistakes or other spells I accidentally omitted, so do go over them carefully when adding
- I use the UA8 Healing Buffs mod so I ignored (Mass) Cure Wounds and (Mass) Healing Word, as those changes would be overridden by the Healing Buffs mod
- For cases where damage die increased by one size, I used 3d4 as the next step up from 1d12, as the increase in the average roll from 1d12->3d4 is more in line with the average increase from 1d10->1d12 than 1d12->2d6
- I skipped adding upcasts for some lower level spells because I couldn't be fucked to do them - no one is gonna be upcasting them to level 7+ anyway

Rebalance - Cantrips:
- Added levelmaps for level 17 scaling, assumed 2d8 for Shillelagh
- Thorn WHip: changed damage die to d4 as intended by original mod

Rebalance - Level 1 Spells:
- Added levlemaps for Witchbolt
- Sleep and Colour Spray: I made my own changes to have the health threshold scale off proficiency bonus, and changed sleep to only target 2 circles instead of 3. You'll have to add the upcast versions for the original mod yourself

Rebalance - Level 3 Spells:
- Hunger of Hadar: entirely removed Syrchalis' changes to the spell in my own file. You'll have to add the upcasts yourself

Rebalance - Level 4 Spells:
- Added levelmaps for Grasping Vine

Rebalance - Level 6 Spells:
- Wall of Ice: added damage fix for Ice Cloud (supposed to be 10d6, mod page says the fix is included but it doesn't seem it was)
